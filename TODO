# Stuff
[ ] Update models_classify.py logic from providing a gigantic list of known model_ids and dumping the second unknown list to classifiy to something a bit bitter.
    What we can do instead is give each model id to be classified (unknown id) a list of most likley matches (just use some prefix match to get 10 most similar) and 
    then ask to classify. To verify, just run cmd `python -m llmbench.benchmark_updater_agent --root-dir `pwd` -b lmsys` and if it fails without error then its fine.
